# sentiment-pcnn

PCNN stands for Piecewise Convolutional Neural Network, written in
Tensorflow.
Considered as an application for sentiment attitudes extraction task.

Dataset
-------
We use [RuSentRel](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel)
corpus consisted of analytical articles from Internet-portal
inosmi.ru.

Installation
------------

Using [virtualenv](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-install-virtualenv-python/).
Create virtual environment, suppose `my_env`, and activate it as follows:
```
virtualenv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```

Use `Makefile` to install
[core](https://github.com/nicolay-r/sentiment-erc-core) library and download
[dataset](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel):
```
make install
```

We use word2vec
[model](http://rusvectores.org/static/models/rusvectores2/news_mystem_skipgram_1000_20_2015.bin.gz)
which were taken from rusvectores.org and used for an embedding layer completion:
```
make download_model
```

Usage
-----
The dataset provides only sentiment attitudes.
For extraction of positive and negative attitudes we additionally introduce
(extract from news) **neutral attudes** to distinguish really sentiment
attitudes from neutral one.

At first, we compose a list of neutral relations per each article by running:
```
./neutrals.py
```
And we are ready to apply model with different settings by simply rinning:
```
./predict_pcnn.py
```
Or a version which implements a cross validation:
```
./predict_pcnn_cv.py
```
