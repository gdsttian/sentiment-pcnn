# sentiment-pcnn

This project represents an implementation of PCNN 
(Piecewise Convolutional Neural Network), written in Tensorflow.
Considered as an application for sentiment attitudes extraction task.

Dataset
-------
We use [RuSentRel 1.0](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel/tree/v1.0/)
corpus consisted of analytical articles from Internet-portal
inosmi.ru.
Table below illustrates CNN/PCNN results in comparison with **baselines**
(neg, pos, distr), and **classifiers** (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) 
based on handcrafted NLP features.
Last row represent an asessment of agreement between two annotators.

| Model               | Precision | Recall | F1(P,N)  |
|--------------------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------:|
|Baseline neg         |  0.03     | 0.39   | 0.05     |
|Baseline pos         |  0.02     | 0.40   | 0.04     |
|Baseline distr       |  0.05     | 0.23   | 0.08     |
|KNN                  |  0.18     | 0.06   | 0.09     |
|SVM (GRID)           |  0.09     | 0.36   | 0.15     |
|Random forest (GRID) |  0.41     | 0.21   | 0.27     |
| **CNN**  		        |  0.41     | 0.23   | **0.31** |
| **PCNN** 		        |  0.42     | 0.23   | **0.31** |
|Expert agreement     |  0.62     | 0.49   | 0.55     |

Installation
------------

Using [virtualenv](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-install-virtualenv-python/).
Create virtual environment, suppose `my_env`, and activate it as follows:
```
virtualenv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```

Use `Makefile` to install
[core](https://github.com/nicolay-r/sentiment-erc-core) library and download
[dataset](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel):
```
make install
```

We use word2vec
[model](http://rusvectores.org/static/models/rusvectores2/news_mystem_skipgram_1000_20_2015.bin.gz)
which were taken from rusvectores.org and used for an embedding layer completion:
```
make download_model
```

Usage
-----
The dataset provides only sentiment attitudes.
For extraction of positive and negative attitudes we additionally introduce
(extract from news) **neutral attudes** to distinguish really sentiment
attitudes from neutral one.

At first, we compose a list of neutral relations per each article by running:
```
./neutrals.py
```
And we are ready to apply model with different settings by simply rinning:
```
./predict_pcnn.py
```
Or a version which implements a cross validation:
```
./predict_pcnn_cv.py
```
